\section{Introduction}

Global illumination (GI) is essential for realistic lighting, as it simulates both direct and indirect light interactions within a scene. Unlike direct illumination, GI captures how light reflects, refracts, and diffuses across surfaces, resulting in more cohesive visuals.

This report explores GI algorithms with an emphasis on GPU-based implementations using compute shaders. It begins with Monte Carlo ray tracing, a probabilistic technique foundational to many physically based rendering methods. The goal is to adapt this approach to 2D, using a discretized Signed Distance Field (SDF) instead of traditional 3D geometry.

To support real-time applications, the report then investigates irradiance field probes—an efficient approximation technique that decouples light sampling from scene geometry. This makes it well-suited for dynamic or large environments where full ray tracing is computationally expensive.

I compare the performance and visual quality of irradiance probes with Monte Carlo ray tracing, and conclude by briefly discussing extensions other works that improve the probe system’s dynamism and memory efficiency, which is something I can maybe explore in the future.

\section{Related Work:}
Global illumination is the sum of all incoming irradiance at a given point, including both direct and indirect light contributions. 

\subsection{Monte Carlo Ray Tracing}
One of the most widely used techniques for simulating global illumination is Monte Carlo ray tracing, a probabilistic method that traces rays from light sources and simulates their interactions with surfaces in a scene. 
The diffuse global illumination (GI) irradiance \( L_0 \) can be recursively \cite{kajiya}. defined as:

\begin{equation}
L_0(p) = L_e(p) + \rho(p) \int_{\Omega} L_0(p', \omega') f_r(p, \omega, \omega') (\omega' \cdot n) \, d\omega'
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( L_0(p) \): The outgoing radiance at point \( p \).
  \item \( L_e(p) \): The emitted radiance at point \( p \).
  \item \( \rho(p) \): The surface reflectance at \( p \).
  \item \( f_r(p, \omega, \omega') \): The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF).
  \item \( \omega' \): The incoming light direction.
  \item \( n \): The surface normal at \( p \).
  \item \( \Omega \): The hemisphere above the surface.
\end{itemize}
 However, Monte Carlo ray tracing can be computationally expensive, requiring many samples to achieve noise-free results. 

\subsection{Challenges of Real-Time GI}
Global illumination techniques like Monte Carlo ray tracing are too slow for real-time use due to their high computational demands. To speed up GI, two main approaches are used: scene representation proxies (like simplified geometry or voxel grids) and precomputing or caching (such as baked lighting in textures or vertices). While these methods improve performance, they struggle with dynamic scenes, as changes require recalculation of precomputed data.

Irradiance fields fall into the category of caching techniques but offer a sparser and more flexible solution. By decoupling lighting information from scene geometry and storing indirect lighting in a grid or probe-based structure, irradiance fields enable real-time GI approximations. This approach allows for cheaper recalculations, striking a balance between performance and visual fidelity.

\subsection{Real-Time GI with Irradiance Probes}
To address the challenges of real-time global illumination, irradiance probes provide an efficient solution for approximating indirect lighting. Irradiance probes decouple light sampling from scene geometry, enabling the calculation of indirect lighting in a more computationally feasible manner. By storing irradiance values in a grid or field throughout the scene, they allow for quick retrieval of lighting information, significantly reducing the cost of real-time global illumination. This method works particularly well in dynamic or large-scale environments where full ray tracing would be too costly. The trade-off is a reduction in accuracy, but in many cases, irradiance probes offer a good balance between performance and visual fidelity.

\subsection{Supercharging Irradiance Fields}
\label{sec:extend}
While irradiance probes offer a practical solution for real-time GI, several advanced techniques can enhance their efficiency and adaptability. Spherical Harmonics (SH) are often used to compactly represent irradiance data, enabling efficient storage and retrieval \cite{sloan2008stupid, schneider2017efficient}. Visibility information can be incorporated into probes to better account for occlusions, improving the accuracy of indirect lighting \cite{silvennoinen2017real}. Dynamic updates with state tracking allow probes to adapt to changes in the scene, ensuring responsiveness in dynamic environments \cite{sedlacek2019real, datta2023adaptive}. Irregular and variably sparse placement of probes, guided by scene complexity or lighting conditions, can further optimize memory usage and computational overhead \cite{vardis2015efficient}. These enhancements collectively improve the quality and performance of irradiance fields in real-time applications.

\section{Approach}
\subsection{SDF-Based Render Pipeline}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{pipeline.pdf}
  \caption{Overview of the 2D rendering pipeline. The input consists of a color image and a mask, which are processed to generate a Signed Distance Field (SDF) using the Jump Flooding Algorithm. Normals are derived from the SDF, and along with the scene color, are passed to the Global Illumination (GI) renderer. The GI renderer, using either Monte Carlo ray tracing or irradiance fields, computes indirect lighting. Finally, the GI result is composited with the scene color, tonemapped, and rendered to the output framebuffer.}

    \caption{Left: Scene color image. Right: Scene mask image.}

    \caption{Left: Surface positions image. Right: Jump flooded scene positions.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{sdf_norm.png}
    \caption{Left: Signed Distance Field. Right: Normals.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Monte Carlo GI in 2D}
We use the 2D buffers shown above to then trace scene using 2D raymarching. This kind of intersection testing is efficient because the SDF provides the minimum distance to all surfaces and at any given position. This allows the ray to skip large sections of the scene while marching. The high level algorithm is the following... (detailed algorithm look into the source code in Section~\ref{sec:sourcecode}).

\subsubsection{Algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initialize ray position at every \textbf{scene position} random unit circle direction.
  \item Initialize ray direction with random unit circle direction.
  \item Set total distance and color contribution to zero.
  \item Repeat for a fixed number of bounces:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform ray marching to detect object intersection.
    \item If no intersection, break the loop.
    \item Add color contribution based on hit properties.
    \item Compute new half-unit circle ray direction for the next bounce.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Blend results if using multiple samples. (Accumilation)
  \item Write final color to global illumination output texture.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Irradiance Probes}
To implement irradiance probes using a sparse grid, we first define the grid layout and perform ray tracing for each probe position. The results are stored in a map layout for efficient querying during rendering.

\subsubsection{Probe Position Initialization}
We define a regular grid of probe positions across the scene, with a parameter \( n \) where \( n \times n \) is the total number of probes. Each probe stores irradiance data computed using the ray tracing algorithm above into a texture. After the radiance has been computed, it can be queried by any position in the scene to get the interpolated GI irradiance.

\subsubsection{Algorithm Compute}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initialize ray position at every \textbf{probe position} random unit circle direction.
  \item Initialize ray direction with random unit circle direction.
  \item Set total distance and color contribution to zero.
  \item Repeat for a fixed number of bounces:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform ray marching to detect object intersection.
    \item If no intersection, break the loop.
    \item Add color contribution based on hit properties.
    \item Compute new half-unit circle ray direction for the next bounce.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Blend results if using multiple samples. (Accumilation)
  \item Write final color to probe's texture.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Algorithm Query}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For a given scene position, find the nearest probe positions in the sparse grid.
  \item Interpolate the irradiance values from the neighboring probes using a weighted average based on distance.
  \item Apply the interpolated irradiance to compute the indirect lighting contribution for the scene position.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{irradiance.png}
  \caption{Left: Irradiance probe positions (marked as the square dots). Right: Irraidance probe irradiance data texture}
\end{figure}

\section{Performance Evaluation}
\subsection{Benchmarks}
The performance of both the Monte Carlo ray tracer and the irradiance probes for global illumination was evaluated against different scenes. The metric used was samples per second (sps), where a higher sps indicates better performance. The output resolution was fixed at 512x512, and the scenes were enclosed to ensure that rays reached the maximum bounce limit, which was set to 8.

To analyze the impact of varying the grid size \( n \), the irradiance probe system was tested with grid sizes ranging from \( n=4 \) to \( n=512 \). 

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../notebook/plot/shapes_scene_average_irradiance_probe_ray_tracing_sampling_speed.pdf}
\end{figure}

\vspace{-28pt}

\begin{figure}[ht]

\vspace{-28pt}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../notebook/plot/door_scene_average_irradiance_probe_ray_tracing_sampling_speed.pdf}
\end{figure}

As anticipated, irradiance probes exhibited significantly better performance by reducing the number of positions requiring irradiance calculations, with runtime scaling according to the grid size \(n^2\). Performance remained consistent across different scenes, which is expected since the enclosed space ensures all rays reach the maximum bounce depth, as they cannot escape. In an open scene, performance differences might emerge as some rays would terminate earlier, reducing the number of required bounces. 

\subsection{Image Comparisons}
The images illustrate how GI quality decreases with lower grid resolutions \( n \). Image D (\( n=32 \)) is the minimum acceptable resolution, as lower values show noticeable artifacts. Beyond image F \( n=64 \), quality improvements are minimal. Irradiance probes at \( n=64 \) were on average 7.4 times faster than Monte Carlo ray tracing.

\section{Conclusion}

Introducing irradiance fields to query global illumination proves to be faster than Monte Carlo ray-tracing every pixel, but at the cost of accuracy.  This trade-off is evident in the benchmarks and image comparisons, where irradiance fields significantly reduce computation time while maintaining acceptable visual quality at higher grid resolutions. However, the reduced accuracy can lead to artifacts such as light leaking or loss of detail in complex lighting scenarios. 

Future work for this project could be exploring the techniques that I mention in Section~\ref{sec:extend}, where people have extended irradiance probes to be more efficient, flexible and dynamic.

In conclusion, this project provided an opportunity to explore both the theoretical and practical aspects of light transport and its optimization for real-time rendering. Additionally, it facilitated learning how to create advanced GPU programs using compute shaders, random number generation, and other techniques essential for crafting bespoke rendering solutions.

% each of the works.

% The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one
% page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

% \section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

% Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
% taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
% search.

% The ACM Computing Classification System ---
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
% classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
% discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
% system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
% commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

% User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
% of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
% the research being presented.

% CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
% articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
% two-page articles (or abstracts).

% \section{Sectioning Commands}

% Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
% \verb|\section|, \verb|\subsection|, \verb|\subsubsection|,
% \verb|\paragraph|, and \verb|\subparagraph|. The sectioning levels up to
% \verb|\subsusection| should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
% from the commands.

% Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
% a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

% Below are examples of sectioning commands.

% \subsection{Subsection}
% \label{sec:subsection}

% This is a subsection.

% \subsubsection{Subsubsection}
% \label{sec:subsubsection}

% This is a subsubsection.

% \paragraph{Paragraph}

% This is a paragraph.

% \subparagraph{Subparagraph}

% This is a subparagraph.

% \section{Tables}

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
% package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
% high-quality tables.

% Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

% Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
% them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
% ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
% environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
% table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
% \textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
% columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
% detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
% \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
% placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
% this document.

% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%   \label{tab:freq}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
%     $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
%     \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
%     $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
%   \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
% live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
% contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
% wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
% desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
% instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
% in the printed output of this document.

% \begin{table*}
%   \caption{Some Typical Commands}
%   \label{tab:commands}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Command &A Number & Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table*}

% Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
% use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
% recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
% more easily.

% \section{Math Equations}
% You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
% inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
% discussed in the next sections.

% \subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
% in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
% which can be invoked with the usual
% \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
% the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
% and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
% \LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
% examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
% \begin{math}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{math},
% set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
% set in display style.  (See next section).

% \subsection{Display Equations}
% A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
% text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
% environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
% \textbf{displaymath} environment.

% Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
% structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
% of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
% equation, shown as an inline equation above:
% \begin{equation}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{equation}
% Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
% the \textbf{displaymath}
% environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
% \begin{displaymath}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
% \end{displaymath}
% and follow it with another numbered equation:
% \begin{equation}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
% \end{equation}
% just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

% \section{Figures}

% The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
% more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
% third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
% in the example below.
% \begin{figure}[h]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
%   \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
%     Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
%     Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
%   \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
% \end{figure}

% Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
% the reader.

% Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

% Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
% decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
% who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
% indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

% A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
% characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
%   should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
%   important information that is not already provided in the caption or
%   the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
% complex new information, a short text description may not be
% adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
% appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
% provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
% structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
% regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
% so important, please see
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

% \subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

% A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
% are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
% the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
% figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
% \verb|\maketitle| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{teaserfigure}
%     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
%     \caption{figure caption}
%     \Description{figure description}
%   \end{teaserfigure}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Citations and Bibliographies}

% The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
% references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
% --- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
% (``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
% reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
% article DOI, etc.

% The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
% commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%   \bibliography{bibfile}
% \end{verbatim}
% where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
% suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

% Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
% ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
% ``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
% command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
% ``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
% \end{verbatim}


%   Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
%   enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
%   issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
%   monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
%   \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
%   \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
%   the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
%   Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
%   a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
%   divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
%   book \cite{Knuth97}, a couple of articles in a proceedings (of a
%   conference, symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings
%   article) \cite{Andler79, Hagerup1993}, a proceedings article with
%   all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
%   proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work
%   \cite{Harel78}, a couple of preprints \cite{Bornmann2019,
%     AnzarootPBM14}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a
%   master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web
%   resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game
%   (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05}
%   and (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
%   publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
%   \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might
%   contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
%   \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton:
%   multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A
%   couple of citations with DOIs:
%   \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Online
%   citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}.
%   Artifacts: \cite{R} and \cite{UMassCitations}.

% \section{Acknowledgments}

% Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
% individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
% preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
% section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
% document.

% This section has a special environment:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{acks}
%   ...
%   \end{acks}
% \end{verbatim}
% so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
% during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
% consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

% Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

% \section{Appendices}

% If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
% ``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
% document.

% Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \appendix
% \end{verbatim}
% and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
% numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
% and subsection identification method.

% \section{Multi-language papers}

% Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
% titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a
% rule, a paper in a language other than English should include an
% English title and an English abstract).  Use \verb|language=...| for
% every language used in the paper.  The last language indicated is the
% main language of the paper.  For example, a French paper with
% additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start with
% the following command
% \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
%                language=french]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}

% The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
% language of the paper.  The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX|
% begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
% in the other languages.  The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is
% used to set the translation of the abstract.  These commands and
% environment have a mandatory first argument: the language of the
% second argument.  See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for examples
% of their usage.

% \section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

% The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
% not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
% a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
% ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
% the margin:
% \begin{description}
% \item[\texttt{sidebar}:]  Place formatted text in the margin.
% \item[\texttt{marginfigure}:] Place a figure in the margin.
% \item[\texttt{margintable}:] Place a table in the margin.
% \end{description}

%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
All my friends and peers <3.
\end{acks}

%%
%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
