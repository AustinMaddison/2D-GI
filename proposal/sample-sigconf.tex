\section{Problem Description}

% In recent years, offline computer graphics have achieved photorealism thanks to advancements in modern hardware, rendering algorithms, tools, and skilled artists. \textit{Avatar: The Way of Water} by W\=et\=a Digital is a prime example, demonstrating the ability to craft virtual worlds that appear almost indistinguishable from reality.

% On the other hand, real-time computer graphics have made significant strides toward achieving similar levels of visual fidelity. However, reaching this target without substantial performance compromises remains a challenge. The key difference lies in constraints---offline rendering is not bound by strict timing requirements, whereas real-time rendering must consistently produce frames in $\leq 26$ms.

One of the most critical components of realistic rendering is \textbf{Indirect Illumination}, also known as \textbf{Global Illumination (GI)}. Offline renderers typically solve for the radiance of visible surfaces in a scene using Monte Carlo Raytracing\cite{kajiya}, iterating until the image converges to a noise-free result. This level of computation is infeasible for real-time rendering budget of $\le$26ms per frame without specialized optimizations because of ray-tracing's long running time to converge.


\section{Literature Review}

Over the past decade, real-time GI solutions have relied on secondary scene representations, probe-based methods, or pre-baked lighting for static environments. These techniques generally fall into the following four categories:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lightmaps}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Store ray-traced lighting data in texture maps.
        \item Baked in advance for static scenes.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Tracing with Alternative Scene Representations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Uses efficient structures such as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Discrete Signed Distance Fields
            \item Voxels 
            \item Proxies (low LOD proxies of LOD0 scene meshes)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Screen-Space Methods}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Raytrace against information in the G-buffer (Depth, Albedo, Normal Buffer). 
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Irradiance Probes}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stores a coarse irradiance field.
        \item Can be precomputed or updated dynamically.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Additional modern techniques that try to bring Monte Carlo Raytracing into realtime include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning (ML)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traces a low number of rays and infers missing details through denoising and upscaling.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Caching \& Reuse}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Temporal Accumulation \& Reprojection}: Uses previous frames to refine current results.
        \item \textbf{ReSTIR}: Reuses and resamples importance-traced rays for efficient global illumination.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Irradiance Probes} Among these techniques, \textbf{Irradiance Probes}\cite{crytek} have been one of the most favorable approaches due to their:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simplicity
    \item Scalabilty
\end{itemize}

However, they have notable \textbf{limitations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They are usually have a coarse resolution because they are placed sparsly which limts their ability to capture fine details in exchange for performance.
\end{itemize}

For non static scenes increasing probe density significantly raises computational costs since the number of required rays scales accordingly, so its a bit of a conundrum. Thus, finding an optimal balance remains a challenge in real-time GI solutions.\\

\paragraph{Radiance Cascades} In 2021, Alexander Sannikov, a programmer at Grinding Gear Games, developed a new GI solution called \textbf{radiance cascades}\cite{sannikov} while working on Path Of Exile 2. This solution draws inspiration from irradiance probes and the relationship between linear and angular resolution required to accurately capture an object's shape within a given area. Radiance cascades demonstrate better fidelity than irradiance probes while having a similar performance.\\

Radiance cascades utilize a hierarchy of cascading probes arranged in a grid. Unlike traditional (like Irradiance Probes) methods that shoot rays in random directions to measure the radiance at a point in the scene, radiance cascades employ a more structured approach. At each successive level in the cascade, the probes become more sparse but have higher angular resolution. This means that as you move up the levels, there are fewer probes, but they can capture more detailed angular information about the light in the scene. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient and accurate global illumination by balancing the density and resolution of probes.\\ 

Notable \textbf{limitations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since of it's complexity, implementing the solution to 3D world-space hasn't been well explored or documented. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Application}
I aim to develop a \textbf{GPU benchmarking program}. This app will allow users to load simple 2D scene descriptions, including lights, primitives, and material definitions. The application will then render the scene using \textbf{three different GI solutions in screen-space} for benchmarking purposes.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Reference Per Pixel Raytracer} \itshape{(non-deterministic)}.
  \item \textbf{Irradiance Probes} \itshape{(non-deterministic)}.
  \item \textbf{Radiance Cascades} \itshape{(deterministic)}.
\end{enumerate}
I chose 2D as it reduces implementation time while still being able to apreciate and draw observatiosn from the different algorithms.

I did a preliminary test of using glsl compute shaders as I never used them before.

\caption{Basic monte carlo raytracer. The left image is rendered with 1 sample, while the right image uses 1024 samples.}
  \label{fig:teaser}
\end{figure}

The rays seem to be biased as thier as certain directions have 


\subsection*{Theory}
For each GI solution I will discuss,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{how they work}
    \item \textbf{time complexity}
\end{enumerate}
How each suceeding GI solution (Monte-Carlo Raytracing $\rightarrow$ Irradiance Probes $\rightarrow$ Radience Cascades) was motivated from the last. 

\subsection*{Practice}
For each GI soltuion I will compare thier performance and fidelity using the outputs from the benchmarking application...
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{running time}
    \item \textbf{image output}
\end{enumerate}




% As mentioned earlier I will integrate each of the GI solutions into application for benchmarking. I will evaluate each GI solution's running time and image output. Irradiance Probes and Radiance Cascades aim to approximate the result of the montecarlo raytraced GI so to compare the difference image output.

% \subsection{Template Parameters}

% In addition to specifying the {\itshape template style} to be used in
% formatting your work, there are a number of {\itshape template parameters}
% which modify some part of the applied template style. A complete list
% of these parameters can be found in the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide.}

% Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\texttt{anonymous,review}}: Suitable for a ``double-anonymous''
%   conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line
%   numbers. Use with the \texttt{\string\acmSubmissionID} command to print the
%   submission's unique ID on each page of the work.
% \item{\texttt{authorversion}}: Produces a version of the work suitable
%   for posting by the author.
% \item{\texttt{screen}}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
% \end{itemize}

% This document uses the following string as the first command in the
% source file:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Modifications}

% Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
% margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
% and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
% vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

% {\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if
%   modifications are discovered.}

% \section{Typefaces}

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
% ``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
% this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
% ``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
% as they will override the built-in typeface families.

% \section{Title Information}

% The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
% \url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
% capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
% your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
% {\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

% If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
% in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
% command has a ``short title'' parameter:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \title[short title]{full title}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Authors and Affiliations}

% Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
% identification.  As an exception, multiple authors may share one
% affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first
% names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever
% possible.

% Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
% alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
%   \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
%   \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
% \end{verbatim}

% The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
% to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
% of an article contributed equally to the work.

% If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
% the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
% overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
% the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
% \end{verbatim}
% Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
% of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
% page headers.

% The article template's documentation, available at
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
% complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
% use.

% Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

% \section{Rights Information}

% Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
% form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
% made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,
% license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

% Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
% copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This
% form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source
% document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and
% their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final
% document:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
% \item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
% \item the conference information in the page header(s).
% \end{itemize}

% Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
% works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
% each of the works.

% The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one
% page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

% \section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

% Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
% taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
% search.

% The ACM Computing Classification System ---
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
% classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
% discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
% system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
% commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

% User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
% of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
% the research being presented.

% CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
% articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
% two-page articles (or abstracts).

% \section{Sectioning Commands}

% Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
% \verb|\section|, \verb|\subsection|, \verb|\subsubsection|,
% \verb|\paragraph|, and \verb|\subparagraph|. The sectioning levels up to
% \verb|\subsusection| should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
% from the commands.

% Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
% a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

% Below are examples of sectioning commands.

% \subsection{Subsection}
% \label{sec:subsection}

% This is a subsection.

% \subsubsection{Subsubsection}
% \label{sec:subsubsection}

% This is a subsubsection.

% \paragraph{Paragraph}

% This is a paragraph.

% \subparagraph{Subparagraph}

% This is a subparagraph.

% \section{Tables}

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
% package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
% high-quality tables.

% Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

% Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
% them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
% ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
% environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
% table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
% \textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
% columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
% detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
% \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
% placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
% this document.

% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%   \label{tab:freq}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
%     $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
%     \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
%     $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
%   \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
% live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
% contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
% wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
% desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
% instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
% in the printed output of this document.

% \begin{table*}
%   \caption{Some Typical Commands}
%   \label{tab:commands}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Command &A Number & Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table*}

% Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
% use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
% recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
% more easily.

% \section{Math Equations}
% You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
% inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
% discussed in the next sections.

% \subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
% in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
% which can be invoked with the usual
% \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
% the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
% and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
% \LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
% examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
% \begin{math}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{math},
% set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
% set in display style.  (See next section).

% \subsection{Display Equations}
% A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
% text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
% environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
% \textbf{displaymath} environment.

% Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
% structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
% of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
% equation, shown as an inline equation above:
% \begin{equation}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{equation}
% Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
% the \textbf{displaymath}
% environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
% \begin{displaymath}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
% \end{displaymath}
% and follow it with another numbered equation:
% \begin{equation}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
% \end{equation}
% just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

% \section{Figures}

% The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
% more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
% third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
% in the example below.
% \begin{figure}[h]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
%   \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
%     Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
%     Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
%   \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
% \end{figure}

% Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
% the reader.

% Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

% Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
% decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
% who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
% indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

% A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
% characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
%   should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
%   important information that is not already provided in the caption or
%   the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
% complex new information, a short text description may not be
% adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
% appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
% provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
% structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
% regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
% so important, please see
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

% \subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

% A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
% are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
% the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
% figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
% \verb|\maketitle| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{teaserfigure}
%     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
%     \caption{figure caption}
%     \Description{figure description}
%   \end{teaserfigure}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Citations and Bibliographies}

% The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
% references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
% --- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
% (``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
% reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
% article DOI, etc.

% The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
% commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%   \bibliography{bibfile}
% \end{verbatim}
% where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
% suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

% Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
% ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
% ``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
% command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
% ``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
% \end{verbatim}


%   Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
%   enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
%   issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
%   monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
%   \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
%   \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output

% \section{Appendices}

% If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
% ``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
% document.

% Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \appendix
% \end{verbatim}
% and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
% numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
% and subsection identification method.

% \section{Multi-language papers}

% Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
% titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a
% rule, a paper in a language other than English should include an
% English title and an English abstract).  Use \verb|language=...| for
% every language used in the paper.  The last language indicated is the
% main language of the paper.  For example, a French paper with
% additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start with
% the following command
% \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
%                language=french]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}

% The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
% language of the paper.  The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX|
% begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
% in the other languages.  The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is
% used to set the translation of the abstract.  These commands and
% environment have a mandatory first argument: the language of the
% second argument.  See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for examples
% of their usage.

% \section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

% The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
% not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
% a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
% ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
% the margin:
% \begin{description}
% \item[\texttt{sidebar}:]  Place formatted text in the margin.
% \item[\texttt{marginfigure}:] Place a figure in the margin.
% \item[\texttt{margintable}:] Place a table in the margin.
% \end{description}

% %%
% %% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
% %% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
% %% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
% %% consistent spelling of the heading.
% \begin{acks}
% To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
% \end{acks}

% %%
% %% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
% %% the bibliography file.
% \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
% \bibliography{sample-base}


% %%
% %% If your work has an appendix, this is the place to put it.
